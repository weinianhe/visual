pip install jpeglib
Pixel data
Decompress the input.jpeg into spatial representation in numpy array with
import jpeglib
im = jpeglib.read_spatial('input.jpeg')
im.spatial
You can specify parameters such as output color space, DCT method, dithering, etc.

Write spatial representation in numpy arrray back to file with

im.write_spatial('output.jpeg')
https://pypi.org/project/jpeglib/


libjpeg version
It is possible to choose, which version of libjpeg should be used.

jpeglib.version.set('6b')
Currently jpeglib supports all versions of libjpeg from 6b to 9e, libjpeg-turbo 2.1.0 and mozjpeg 4.0.3. Their source codes is baked inside the package and thus distributed with it, avoiding external dependency.

Get currently used libjpeg version by

version = jpeglib.version.get()
You can also set a libjpeg version for a scope only.

jpeglib.version.set('6b')
im = jpeglib.read_spatial('image.jpeg') # using 6b
with jpeglib.version('9e'):
    im = jpeglib.read_spatial('image.jpeg') # using 9e
im = jpeglib.read_spatial('image.jpeg') # using 6b again
